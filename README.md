Megaline is a federal mobile operator that offers two tariff plans to its clients: Smart and Ultra. In order to adjust the advertising budget, the commercial department wants to understand which tariff plan brings in more money. A preliminary analysis of the tariffs on a small sample of clients needs to be done. There are data available on 500 Megaline users, including who they are, where they are from, which tariff plan they use, and how many calls and messages each sent in 2018. It is necessary to analyze the behavior of the clients and come to a conclusion about which tariff plan is better.
